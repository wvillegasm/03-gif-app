# Changes Report

## Branch: feature/implement-delete-item-row

### Files Modified:

1. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Enhanced AI coding instructions
2. `src/FirstStepsApp.tsx` - Added delete item functionality to parent component
3. `src/components/ItemCounter.tsx` - Implemented delete button functionality
4. `homworks/react-basic.md` - Deleted (renamed directory)

### Files Added:

- `homeworks/` directory (corrected spelling from `homworks/`)

### Summary of Changes:

#### 1. Delete Item Functionality Implementation

- **Added `handleDeleteItem` function** in `FirstStepsApp.tsx` that removes items from the product list using `filter()`
- **Updated `ItemCounterProps` interface** to include `onDeleteItem` callback prop
- **Connected delete button** in `ItemCounter.tsx` to trigger the delete functionality
- **Maintained immutable state updates** following established patterns

#### 2. AI Coding Instructions Enhancement

- **Added Pull Request generation guidelines** to `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- **Fixed typo** in directory name reference from "homworks" to "homeworks"
- **Included template structure** for PR descriptions and change tracking

#### 3. Directory Structure Correction

- **Moved homework files** from `homworks/` to properly spelled `homeworks/` directory

### Architecture Patterns Followed:

- ✅ Parent-to-child communication via props
- ✅ Child-to-parent communication via callback functions
- ✅ Immutable state updates using functional array methods
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces for prop definitions
- ✅ Descriptive callback naming conventions

### State Management Pattern Used:

```tsx
const handleDeleteItem = (name: string) => {
  setProductItems((prevItems) =>
    prevItems.filter((item) => item.name !== name)
  );
};
```

This follows the established pattern of using functional updates with immutable operations.
