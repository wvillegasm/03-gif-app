# Pull Request: Implement Delete Item Functionality

## üìù Summary

This PR implements the delete item functionality for product items in the React First Steps educational project. Users can now remove individual items from the product list by clicking the "Delete" button on each item row. The implementation follows the established patterns of parent-child component communication and immutable state management.

**Type of Change:** Feature Enhancement

## üí• Breaking Changes

**No breaking changes.** This is a purely additive feature that doesn't modify existing APIs or component interfaces beyond adding an optional delete capability.

## ‚ú® Changes Details

### `src/FirstStepsApp.tsx`

- **Added `handleDeleteItem` function**: Implements item removal using `filter()` method to create new array without the deleted item
- **Updated JSX**: Added `onDeleteItem` prop to `ItemCounter` components to pass down the delete handler
- **Maintained immutable state pattern**: Follows existing convention of functional state updates

### `src/components/ItemCounter.tsx`

- **Extended `ItemCounterProps` interface**: Added `onDeleteItem: (name: string) => void` prop
- **Updated component parameters**: Destructured the new `onDeleteItem` prop
- **Connected delete button**: Added `onClick` handler that calls `onDeleteItem(name)` when delete button is clicked
- **Maintained TypeScript strict typing**: All props properly typed with explicit interfaces

### `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

- **Added PR generation guidelines**: Included comprehensive instructions for AI agents to generate change reports and PR descriptions
- **Fixed directory name typo**: Corrected "homworks" to "homeworks" in documentation
- **Enhanced template structure**: Added sections for change tracking and PR formatting

### Directory Structure

- **Corrected `homeworks/` directory**: Fixed spelling from previous `homworks/` directory
- **Created `changes/` directory**: Added structure for tracking changes and PR documentation

## üñºÔ∏è Screenshots / GIFs

_Feature demonstrates deletion of items from a list UI - each item row has a delete button that removes the item when clicked._

## ‚úÖ Testing

- [x] **Manual Testing**: Verified delete functionality works correctly for all product items
- [x] **TypeScript Compilation**: No type errors, all interfaces properly defined
- [x] **ESLint Validation**: Passes all linting rules without warnings
- [x] **Component Communication**: Confirmed proper parent-child callback pattern
- [x] **State Management**: Verified immutable updates maintain React best practices
- [x] **Edge Cases**: Tested deletion of all items (leaves empty list)

### Test Scenarios Covered:

1. Delete individual items from the list
2. Delete all items (empty state)
3. Verify remaining items maintain correct state
4. Confirm no side effects on quantity controls

## üëÄ Reviewers

**Educational Context Reviewers:**

- Focus on code clarity and educational value
- Verify patterns align with React fundamentals curriculum
- Check TypeScript best practices for learning

**Technical Reviewers:**

- Validate state management implementation
- Review component communication patterns
- Confirm adherence to project conventions

### Implementation Notes

This implementation demonstrates key React concepts suitable for educational purposes:

- **State Management**: Using `useState` with functional updates
- **Component Communication**: Parent-child communication via props and callbacks
- **Immutable Updates**: Array `filter()` method for state modifications
- **TypeScript Integration**: Proper interface definitions and type safety
- **Event Handling**: onClick handlers with closure over component data

The code follows the established patterns documented in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and maintains consistency with existing codebase conventions.
